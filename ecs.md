## 5. For Repository name, enter a unique name for your repository. The repository name can be specified on its own (for example nginx-web-app). Alternatively, it can be prepended with a namespace to group the repository into a category (for example project-a/nginx-web-app).
## 6. For Tag immutability, choose the tag mutability setting for the repository. Repositories configured with immutable tags prevent image tags from being overwritten. For more information, see Image tag mutability.
## 7. For Scan on push, choose the image scanning setting for the repository. Repositories that are configured to scan on push start an image scan whenever an image is pushed. If you want to start an image scan at a different time, you need to manually start the image scans. For more information, see Image scanning.

## 8. For KMS encryption, choose whether to enable encryption of the images in the repository using AWS Key Management Service. By default, when KMS encryption is enabled, Amazon ECR uses an AWS managed key (KMS key) with the alias aws/ecr. This key is created in your account the first time that you create a repository with KMS encryption enabled. For more information, see Encryption at rest.
## 9. When KMS encryption is enabled, select Customer encryption settings (advanced) to choose your own KMS key. The KMS key must be in the same Region as the cluster. Choose Create an AWS KMS key to navigate to the AWS KMS console to create your own key.

## 10. Choose Create Repository
## Your Repository has been Created.
# *Pushing an image to your Repository*
## 1. Select the repository that you created and choose View push commands to view the steps to push an image to your new repository.
## 2. If you have a Dockerfile for the image to push, build the image and tag it for your new repository. Using the docker build command from the console in a terminal window. Make sure that you are in the same directory as your Dockerfile. (optional)
## 3. Tag the image with your Amazon ECR registry URI and your new repository by pasting the docker tag command from the console into a terminal window. The console command assumes that your image was built from a Dockerfile in the previous step. If you did not build your image from a Dockerfile, replace the first instance of repository:latest with the image ID or image name of your local image to push.
## 4. Push the newly tagged image to your repository by using the docker push command in a terminal window.
## Choose Close.

## 3. For Task definition family, specify a unique name for the task definition.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95855861/159851352-38204bbe-382f-4f4a-84e2-be1dddcac623.png)

## 4. For each container to define in your task definition, complete the following steps.
##   a) For Name, specify a name for the container.

##   b) For Image URI, specify the image to use to start a container. Images in the Docker Hub registry are may be specified using the Docker Hub registry name only. For example, if amazonlinux:latest is specified, the Amazon Linux container hosted on Docker Hub is used. For all other repositories, specify the repository using either the repository-url/image:tag or repository-url/image@digest formats.
##   c) For Essential container, if your task definition has two or more containers defined, you may specify whether the container should be considered essential. If a container is marked as essential, if that container stops then the task is stopped. Each task definition must contain at least one essential container.
## d) For Container port and Protocol, specify the port mapping to use for the container. A port mapping allows the container to access ports on the host to send or receive traffic. Choose Add more port mappings to specify additional container port mappings.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95855861/159851948-1eaa433c-5e80-4889-92c2-277929172caa.png)

## e) Expand the Environment variables section to specify environment variables to inject into the container. You can specify environment variables either individually using key-value pairs or in bulk by specifying an environment variable file hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. For information on how to format an environment variable file, see Specifying environment variables.
## f) Choose Add more containers to add additional containers to the task definition. Choose Next once all containers have been defined. (optional)
